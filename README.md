# COVID-19 Travel Guide

Group project developed as part of Web Design Workshop. Home page use PHP and MySQL to call and display data from a database table. With a specific page, the user can change one of the seven entries in the table and subsequently one of the articles on the index page.

United States page uses Google Geocharts in conjunction with an API that has COVID-19 data for each state and county. The World page uses two different APIs, one for global statistics overall and another for data for each major country. 

All of the index page and World page, and around half of the United States page, is my original work. Logo and styling were courtesy of other group members.
